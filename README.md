# unclog
vibe coded to handle my printing business process, it unclogs all the tasks that used to get stuck in a poor pipeline

I've created a **Daily Production Scheduler** app with all your requirements! Here's what it includes:

## Features Implemented:
1. ✅ **Daily capacity limits** per product (e.g., 2 apples, 3 oranges)
2. ✅ **Smart order scheduling** - automatically assigns orders across days based on capacity
3. ✅ **Adjustable limits** - easily modify daily capacity as needed
4. ✅ **Dashboard** with pipeline, weekly schedule, and metrics
5. ✅ **Notifications** - visual alerts when capacity is reached
6. ✅ **Material tracking** - define raw materials per unit, auto-calculate consumption when orders complete
7. ✅ **Kanban-style workflow** - inspired by Japanese lean manufacturing
